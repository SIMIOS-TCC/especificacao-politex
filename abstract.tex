This study presents the design and implementation of an entire system capable of assisting animal health and biology researchers monitoring the object of study. Therefore, an embedded wearable was programmed so that the system could provide the researcher remotely with the observed animals’ location. For that to happen, they would have to be living in a natural reserve mapped by a wireless sensor network. This system’s purpose is to meet Instituto Butantã’s needs regarding monitoring apes inside the reserve. However, it is expected that this system is also applicable inside many different reserves, for distinct mammals observation and open to be expanded so that it shall be able to monitor as many other control variables the biologist or veterinary finds relevant. The final work meets the defined requirements and shows scalability.
